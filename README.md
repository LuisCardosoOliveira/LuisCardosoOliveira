# Hi, I'm Luis  🏊🚴🏃 💻 :fr: 🦀


I'm a **Sofware Engineer** and I'm passionate about **technology**.

I'm passionate about **problem-solving, statistics and algorithms**. One of my favourites topics in Computer Science is **Data Structures** and I love to create all sort of algorithms to help me solve problems. I guess one of the best qualities a Developer can have is ***analytical thinking*** 

I care deeply about unlocking the power of technology for individuals and businesses, so they can use computers in a way that was previously unrealistic for them. I find joy in ambiguity and unknown and feel more engaged when working on problems that can't be solved by merely searching the web or reading a book. Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers!

I'm Brazilian and I'm currently living in **Paris** :fr: and actively participate in local and international community activities and events.

I love to code :computer:, surf :surfer: and learn new things :books:!
